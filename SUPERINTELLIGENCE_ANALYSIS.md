## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each new capability should be a well-defined module that interfaces with existing systems

2. **Biological Inspiration**: Maintain neuromorphic principles where possible

3. **Scalability**: Design all components to scale to large networks and datasets

4. **Composability**: Modules should work together synergistically

5. **Testability**: Each module should be independently testable

### Integration Approach

**Hierarchical Organization**:
```
Level 5: Meta-Cognitive (Self-Improvement, Meta-Learning)
         |
Level 4: Executive (Planning, Goals, Decision-Making)
         |
Level 3: Cognitive (Reasoning, Language, Memory)
         |
Level 2: Representation (Concepts, Symbols, World Model)
         |
Level 1: Sensory-Motor (Vision, Audio, Actions) [CURRENT]
```

Each level builds upon and enhances the capabilities of lower levels while maintaining the self-organizing principles.

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Predictive Coding**: All modules should make predictions and learn from errors

2. **Hierarchical Processing**: Information flows bottom-up and top-down

3. **Attention Mechanisms**: Selective processing of relevant information

4. **Memory Systems**: Both fast (working) and slow (episodic/semantic) memory

5. **Active Learning**: System should seek information to reduce uncertainty
