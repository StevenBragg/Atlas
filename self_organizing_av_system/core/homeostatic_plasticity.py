    Implements homeostatic plasticity mechanisms to maintain stable neural activity.
    
    Homeostatic plasticity refers to the brain's ability to maintain stability
    while still allowing for learning and adaptation. This module implements several
    mechanisms:
    
    1. Intrinsic excitability regulation
    2. Synaptic scaling to normalize input strength
    3. Lateral inhibition for competition and sparse coding
    4. Target activity regulation to maintain desired activity levels
    5. Heterosynaptic competition to balance connection strengths
    
    These mechanisms work together to prevent runaway excitation, maintain
    representational stability, and encourage efficient sparse coding.
